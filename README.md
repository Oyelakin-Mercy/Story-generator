# Story-generator
I created a web application that generates random story when the "Generate random story" button is pressed.
<p>It also replaces the default name "Bob" in the story with a custom name, only if a custom name is entered into the "Enter custom name" text field before the generate button is pressed.</p>
<p>
It converts the default US weight and temperature quantities and units in the story into UK equivalents if the UK radio button is checked before the generate button is pressed.
and will generate another random silly story if you press the button again (and again...)
